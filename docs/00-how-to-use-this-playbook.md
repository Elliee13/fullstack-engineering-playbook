# How to Use This Playbook

## Who this is for
- Personal projects: fast, safe defaults
- Teams: shared standards and a consistent shipping bar

## The 5 filters (use these to “activate” only what you need)
1) **Auth style**: cookie sessions vs JWT (+ refresh rotation)
2) **Data ownership model**: A personal / B workspace / C enterprise isolation
3) **Scale level**: small → growing → high scale
4) **Uploads**: none vs signed URLs + private buckets
5) **Money/critical actions**: idempotency + audit logs + stricter monitoring

## Recommended workflow
- Kickoff checklist (docs/08)
- Implement standards relevant to your filters
- Validate before launch (docs/09)
